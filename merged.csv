In order to meet this target, the reform and continuation of the MEP schemes was decided. The two previous schemes were combined into a new scheme called SDE (stimulering duurzame energie). In August 2007 the Dutch government submitted the scheme for approval under EC Treaty state aid rules. In December the European Commission auhorised the aid scheme, to stimulate production of renewable energy and Combined Heat and Power. The extra available budget for the SDE is estimated at EUR 2,144 million. Unlike the MEP, the SDE is fully financed by direct government support. The regulation was published on 3 March 2008, and subsidy requests can be submitted as of 1 April 2008 from SenterNovem, the Ministry of Economic Affairs agency. Differences from the MEP are that projects are selected through tendering, and that the subsidy amounts will be corrected and vary depending on fossil fuel energy prices. Also, hydro projects are not eligible, though the scheme applies also to biogas. The scheme can be called a ""modified feed-in tariff""; a fixed subsidy is guaranteed, as in a feed-in tariff, with an option for a higher price per kWh if the electricity price goes above the subsidy ceiling. Thus, renewable energy producers are provided a fixed price per kWh. The scheme acts as a premium if the electricity price goes below the feed-in tariff. However, if the market electricity price is at or above the feed-in tariff price, no subsidy is received from the government. For example, the estimated subsidy amount in 2008 for sewage-gas and waste water electricity, as well as high efficiency waste generation is zero, since the wholesale market price is expected to be higher than the estimated cost of production from these technologies. Offshore wind is not eligible for subsidies in 2008 and 2009; the first tender will be in 2010. In addition, annual expenditures are capped by technology. Estimated yearly caps are calculated based on capacity installed and estimated installations from 2008 to 2011. These are: EUR 1 million for biogas from sewage and waste water; EUR 19 million for small-scale PV (0.6 kWp-3.5 kWp); EUR 68 million for biomass CHP, co-digestion of food industry waste and manure; EUR 119 million for off-shore wind; EUR 129 million for on-shore wind.

The main focus is on increasing domestic production of a specific good or service. Specifically, the President can direct private entities to give priority to purchases by the government for national defense. In addition, the President can waive international trade requirements in order to secure a supply chain from a foreign source, investigate certain firms, goods, or industries if necessary, and require the installation of certain equipment or other measures at production plants. </div><div>The original purpose of this act was to ensure the availability of materiel for military defense during the Korean War. However, it is also available to address other identifiable crises within the country within the jurisdiction of the law, including natural and man-made disasters. There have been several notable uses of the act beyond the traditional sphere of national defense. In 2000, President Bill Clinton invoked the act to secure the production of gas and electricity during a shortage in California. In 2011, President Obama invoked it due to growing concerns of espionage from China, making telecommunication companies report on their hardware and software components coming from a foreign source. President Trump invoked the act three times, once in 2017 and twice in 2020. In 2017, President Trump used the act to secure the supply of an array of products deemed critical for national defense – including microelectronics, aerospace structures, and satellite components. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump invoked it to ensure production of ventilators and N95 Respirators. He then invoked it one more time in April 2020 to ensure the opening of plants of production for poultry, eggs, beef and pork during the pandemic. President Biden invoked the act in January 2021 to secure the production of COVID-19 vaccinations and in September 2021 to secure the production of fire hoses to mitigate the effects of wildfires around the country. </div><div>In recent years, the act has been seen as a potential mechanism for the government to address security of supply of critical minerals. In March 2022, President Biden signed <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/31/memorandum-on-presidential-determination-pursuant-to-section-303-of-the-defense-production-act-of-1950-as-amended/"">Presidential Determination No. 2022-11</a> authorising the use of the act to strengthen the domestic battery capacity, including to direct increases in domestic mining and processing capacity for battery materials. Similarly, in June 2022, President Biden signed a series of Presidential Determinations invoking the Act to support domestic clean energy manufacturing and clean energy projects, including support for the manufacturing of heat pumps, electrolyzers, solar modules (and components), insulation material, and fuel cells; and waiver on solar panel imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The new law was amended two times and entered into force in July 2016. The Law replaces the green certificate system with auction scheme. The first auction took place on 30th of December 2016 with results being announced early January 2017. Further auctions took place in spring 2017 and were scheduled as well for summer and autumn 2017. However, the latter two 2017 auction rounds were canceled as the Act was not clear on combining auction contract with other forms of public support breaching EU’s rules on fair competition. These inaccuracies triggered work on the subsequent amendment to the Act that entered into force on 29th of June 2018. The June 2018 amendment modified the auction system and in effect unblocked it. The Energy Regulatory Office (URE) of Poland is obliged to organise and run auction rounds by the end of 2018 and in 2019 in order to bring new renewable power capacity into the system. The June 2018 amendment modified auction technology baskets. The new baskets are as follow: <br> |  Basket  (PL: “Koszyk”)  |  Technologies eligible <br> |  Basket 1  |  1) installations using only biogas obtained from landfills; 2) installations using only biogas obtained from sewage treatment plants; 3) installations using only biogas other than those specified in items 1 and 2 above; 4) exclusively dedicated biomass combustion installations or hybrid systems; 5) only installations using biomass, biogas, biogas or agricultural biogas incinerated in a dedicated multi-fuel combustion plant; 6) exclusively dedicated to biomass combustion installations or hybrid systems, in high-efficiency cogeneration. <br> |  Basket 2  |  1) installations using only hydropower for electricity generation and 2) installations using only geothermal energy for generating electricity, as well 3) installations using only offshore wind energy. <br> |  Basket 3  |  Agriculture biogas installations <br> |  Basket 4  |  1) onshore wind 2) solar PV installations <br> |  Basket 5  |  Hybrid installations Projects selected through auction processes will receive 15 year long Power Purchase Agreements. The design and introduction of the auction support system was a revolutionary change in the area of support for electricity generation from renewable sources. This system ensures the competitiveness of entities entering the auctions, which translates into maximum favourable electricity prices, and consequently has an impact on the cost of electricity offered to end users. The auction is won by entrepreneurs who offered the lowest energy sales price. The principles of the auction mechanism, together with subsequent updates of the RES Act, were subject to changes, which concerned, among others, the system of division into so-called ""auction baskets"". Over the period of several years the auction settlement method has also evolved. The auctions held in 2016 and 2017 were won by participants who offered the lowest selling price - until the quantity or value of this energy specified in the auction announcement is exhausted. The amendment to the Act of 2018 introduced the so-called rule of enforcing competition. According to this rule, the auction is won by the participants who offered the lowest energy sale price and whose bids did not exceed 100 per cent of the value or amount of energy specified in the auction announcement and 80 per cent of the amount of electricity covered by all submitted bids. Such a provision allows to avoid a situation in which all bids win the auction, even if the amount or value of electricity in the submitted bids does not exhaust the entire volume or value indicated in the announcement.</div>",POL

The programme provides grants to low-income households for insulation and heating retrofits, and is administered by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA). To be eligible for an insulation grant under this programme a person needs to own the home they live in, that home must have been built before 2008, and they need to have either a Community Services Card or live in an area identified as low income. Low income households are determined using the New Zealand Deprivation Index, a tool commonly used in health planning to define low-income areas. Houses located in deprivation areas rated 8, 9 and 10 are eligible for grants.

The first year of the programme focussed on insulation as the highest priority for creating warm, dry homes, with grants for heating available from July 2019. The original aim was to insulate, or install a heater (some houses will receive both) 52,000 houses over the four years of the programme.  

In 2020 the programme was supplemented with an additional $56 million in funding which allows 9,000 additional houses to be retrofitted. The grants now cover 90% of the cost of getting insulation or a heater installed. The grant cap for heaters is $3000.",NZL
